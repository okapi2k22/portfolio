## Background
For a soccer player, their most important purchase is footwear. There are multiple different types of soccer shoes that vary by playing surface, price, comfort, and color. Depending on the field conditions, having the right shoes can severely impact a player's performance.

## Problem
Purchasing soccer shoes from online soccer stores is a painful user experience, especially for novices. 

For instance, top stores allow users to filter shoes by certain categories; however, they don't provide any context for the filters. Many users end up having to piece together information themselves through trial and error.

How might we create a website that recommends soccer shoes for beginners in a fun, personalized, educational way?

## Solution
My solution is a soccer footwear recommender website called Cleatwiz.
