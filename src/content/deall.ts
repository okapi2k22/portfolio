# Deall
Iterative design of a job application site

<Image src="deall-hero.png" alt="Deall's landing page">

## Background
Deall is a Y-Combinator startup from Indonesia that aims to make the job-hunting process easier for both employers and job-seekers.

## Problem
The problem is that the job-hunting process is stressful, frustrating, and boring. Most job boards require job-seekers to sift through vast amounts of job postings with little to no return. 

Although Deall tries to simplify the job-hunting process, their interface is still too overwhelming for job-seekers.

## Challenge
The challenge was to design a simpler interface for Deall.

## Solution
My solution was to create a new web interface for job-seekers on Deall.

## Simple, Modern Interface
Job-seeking is a stressful process, boring process. To entice new job-seekers to use Deall, the new web interface need a simple, modern appearance. 

Following the conventions of other tech startups, the new Deall interface uses bold sans-serif typography and a lush, saturated color scheme.

## Relevant, Chunked Information
The job-hunting process is so frustrating for job-seekers because most job boards force job-seekers to scan through vast list of job postings. The new Deal interface reduces the burden by chunking job postings.

Firstly, the new interface chunks job posts that users can easily discover relevant job postings.

Secondly, the interface chunks job postings with urgent deadlines so that users don't forget to apply to certain job posts.

## Easy, Customized Mass Applying
The job-hunting process is frustrating for job-seekers because most job boards force job-seekers to individually apply to every job. Job boards lack the feature of grouping certain job-postings together.

The new interface allows the user to create their own lists and groupings of job postings, and apply to them with a single, relevant resume.
